# Game Of Red Buttons
Nuclear war simulator, inpired by Trump-Kim Jong Un confrontation. Press the red button before your enemy does. But remember: bigger button work better! 

## Update from the year 2025:
The joke aged like fine milk â€“ nobody remembers the "my nuclear button is much bigger and more powerful" quote, and Trump and Kim are now best pals.
